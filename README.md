### A Themed Whack-A-Mole Style Game

## Introduction

Welcome to Hacker Whacker Extended, an extension on the original whack-a-mole style game Hacker Whacker. Both projects involved the same programming team.

The original game was created during Hackathon 2 of Code Institute's "16-Week High-Performance Full Stack Skills Bootcamp" which ranged from 02/07/2024 (from 9am) to 04/07/2024 (up to 1.30pm). This extension is to give a chance for the developers to progress the project beyond the scope of the assessment and to further refine their programming skills.
